## Scenario Modeling Capabilities

### Base Scenarios

The system includes four pre-configured scenarios:

1. **Base Case** (Default)
   - Synergy Multiplier: 1.0x
   - Risk Multiplier: 1.0x
   - Discount Rate: 10%

2. **Optimistic**
   - Synergy Multiplier: 1.2x (20% higher synergies)
   - Risk Multiplier: 0.8x (20% lower risk)
   - Discount Rate: 8%

3. **Pessimistic**
   - Synergy Multiplier: 0.8x (20% lower synergies)
   - Risk Multiplier: 1.3x (30% higher risk)
   - Discount Rate: 12%

4. **Conservative**
   - Synergy Multiplier: 0.9x (10% lower synergies)
   - Risk Multiplier: 1.1x (10% higher risk)
   - Discount Rate: 11%

### Synergy Analysis

The system models four types of synergies:

1. **Cost Synergies** (15% of deal value)
   - Personnel reductions
   - Operational efficiencies
   - Technology consolidation

2. **Revenue Synergies** (8% of deal value)
   - Cross-selling opportunities
   - Market expansion
   - Customer base growth

3. **Tax Synergies** (3% of deal value)
   - Tax optimization
   - Structure benefits
   - Jurisdiction advantages

4. **Financial Synergies** (5% of deal value)
   - Lower cost of capital
   - Improved financing terms
   - Balance sheet optimization

### Risk-Adjusted Metrics

The system calculates probability of success based on risk findings:

- **High Success (80%):** ≤5 high-risk findings, no critical findings
- **Good Success (70%):** 6-10 high-risk findings, no critical findings
- **Moderate Success (60%):** >10 high-risk findings, no critical findings
- **Low Success (50%):** 3-5 critical findings
- **Poor Success (30%):** >5 critical findings

### Monte Carlo Simulation

The Monte Carlo simulation generates 1,000 scenarios for each deal, modeling:

- Deal value variations (±20% from base case)
- Synergy realization rates (60%-120% of projected)
- Integration cost overruns (0%-50% above budget)
- Timeline delays (0%-100% extension)

## Advanced Visualization Types

### 1. Heatmaps
- **Risk Severity Matrix:** Shows risk distribution by category and severity
- **Scenario Comparison:** Normalized metrics across scenarios

### 2. Bubble Charts
- **Risk-Adjusted NPV:** Size = deal value, X = success probability, Y = NPV

### 3. Waterfall Charts
- **Synergy Breakdown:** Shows contribution of each synergy type

### 4. Tornado Charts
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Shows impact of key variables on NPV

### 5. Treemaps
- **Risk Impact:** Hierarchical view of risks by deal and category
- **Decision Trees:** Expected values for different decision paths

### 6. Radar Charts
- **Financial Performance:** Multi-dimensional company comparison

### 7. Gantt Charts
- **Deal Timelines:** Project schedules with dependencies

## Interactive Features

### Native Filters

All dashboards include native filters for:

- **Deal Status:** Filter by active, completed, cancelled deals
- **Industry:** Filter by industry sector
- **Date Range:** Filter by deal creation or completion dates
- **Deal Value Range:** Filter by transaction size
- **Scenario Selection:** Choose modeling scenario
- **Synergy Multipliers:** Adjust synergy assumptions

### Cross-Filtering

Charts are interconnected - selecting data points in one chart filters related charts:

- Selecting an industry filters all charts to that industry
- Clicking a deal in one chart highlights it across all visualizations
- Time period selections apply across all time-based charts

### Drill-Down Capabilities

Most charts support drill-down functionality:

- **Summary → Detail:** Click aggregate metrics to see underlying data
- **Company → Deal:** Click company metrics to see specific deals
- **Category → Individual:** Click risk categories to see specific findings

# Get dashboard data
GET /api/v1/dashboard/{id}

# Export dashboard
GET /api/v1/dashboard/{id}/export/pdf/

# Get chart data
POST /api/v1/chart/data

# Get dataset information
GET /api/v1/dataset/{id}
```

### Frontend Integration

Embed dashboards in the AMAN frontend:

```javascript
// Embed dashboard iframe
<iframe
  src="http://localhost:8088/superset/dashboard/aman-executive-dashboard/?standalone=true"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
  frameBorder="0"
/>

// Use Superset SDK for advanced integration
import { SupersetClient } from '@superset-ui/core';

const client = new SupersetClient({
  host: 'http://localhost:8088',
  credentials: 'include'
});
```

## Performance Optimization

### Database Views

All dashboards use optimized database views:

- **Pre-aggregated data** reduces query time
- **Indexed columns** improve filter performance
- **Materialized views** for complex calculations

### Caching Strategy

- **Dashboard cache:** 5 minutes for real-time data
- **Chart cache:** 10 minutes for detailed analysis
- **Dataset cache:** 1 hour for reference data

### Query Optimization

- **Row limits** prevent excessive data loading
- **Time partitioning** for historical analysis
- **Async queries** for long-running calculations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Slow Dashboard Loading**
   - Check database query performance
   - Verify cache configuration
   - Review row limits and filters

2. **Missing Data**
   - Verify database views exist
   - Check data permissions
   - Confirm agent data pipeline

3. **Export Failures**
   - Check Superset export configuration
   - Verify file system permissions
   - Review browser compatibility

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor dashboard performance through:

- **Query execution times** in SQL Lab
- **Cache hit rates** in Superset logs
- **Database performance** metrics
- **User interaction** analytics

## Best Practices

### Dashboard Design

1. **Limit charts per dashboard** (8-12 maximum)
2. **Use consistent color schemes** across related charts
3. **Provide clear titles and descriptions**
4. **Include data freshness indicators**
5. **Optimize for different screen sizes**

### Data Modeling

1. **Create purpose-built views** for each dashboard
2. **Pre-calculate complex metrics** in database
3. **Use appropriate data types** for performance
