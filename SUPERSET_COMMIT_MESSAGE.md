- docker/superset/README.md - Comprehensive documentation
- docker/superset/ADVANCED_ANALYTICS_GUIDE.md - User guide
- docker/superset/STARTUP_GUIDE.md - Quick start instructions

## Files Modified:
- docker-compose.yml - Added Superset service configuration

## Requirements Satisfied:
- âœ… 8.1: Install and configure Apache Superset with PostgreSQL connection
- âœ… 8.3: Build comprehensive M&A analysis dashboards in Superset  
- âœ… 8.4: Create scenario modeling interfaces for what-if analysis
- âœ… 8.4: Implement automated report generation and export functionality

## Usage:
1. Start services: `docker-compose up -d`
2. Access Superset: http://localhost:8088 (admin/admin123)
3. View dashboards: Executive, Comprehensive Analysis, Scenario Modeling
4. Run tests: `python docker/superset/test_complete_integration.py`

## Breaking Changes:
None - This is a new feature addition that doesn't affect existing functionality.

## Performance Impact:
- Adds ~500MB memory usage for Superset container
- Database views improve query performance for analytics
- Redis caching reduces dashboard load times
