- **Performance Forecasting**: 30/60/90-day forecasts with confidence intervals
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Optimal maintenance timing recommendations

### 3. Automated Reporting Engine (`automated_reporting.py`)
- **AI-Powered Reports**: Comprehensive health reports with AI insights
- **Executive Summaries**: Business-ready summaries for leadership
- **Multi-Report Types**: Daily, weekly, monthly, and incident reports
- **Automated Scheduling**: Configurable report generation intervals

### 4. Full Integration (`monitoring_agent.py`)
- **Unified Interface**: All AI diagnostics accessible through MonitoringAgent
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking AI analysis operations
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time status of AI diagnostic capabilities

## ðŸ”§ Key Features Implemented

### AI-Powered Diagnostics
```python
# Root cause analysis from system data
diagnosis = await ai_diagnostics.diagnose_system_issues(system_data)

# Error pattern analysis
error_analysis = await ai_diagnostics.analyze_error_logs(error_logs)

# Performance optimization recommendations
optimization = await ai_diagnostics.optimize_system_performance(performance_data)

# Predictive maintenance forecasting
maintenance = await ai_diagnostics.predict_system_maintenance(historical_data)
```

### Predictive Maintenance
```python
# Trend analysis and forecasting
trends = maintenance_engine.analyze_system_trends(days_back=30)
alerts = maintenance_engine.predict_maintenance_needs(forecast_days=90)
schedule = maintenance_engine.get_maintenance_schedule(days_ahead=60)
```

### Automated Reporting
```python
# Generate comprehensive health reports
report = await reporting_engine.generate_health_report("weekly")
# Includes: executive summary, AI insights, recommendations, action items
```
