# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Autonomous M&A Navigator (AMAN) is a multi-agent AI system designed to automate comprehensive due diligence processes for mergers and acquisitions. The system addresses the critical problem that 70% of M&A deals fail due to incomplete, rushed, or error-prone manual due diligence processes. AMAN provides autonomous analysis across financial, legal, technical, human capital, and market dimensions while offering transparency, recursive analysis capabilities, and post-merger synergy simulation.
