# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on ensuring robust and reliable connection between the existing database schema and PostgreSQL database. The system currently has a comprehensive schema with tables for companies, deals, agent executions, findings, financial data, and timeline estimates, along with database utilities for connection management. This enhancement will address connection reliability, error handling, migration management, and monitoring to ensure seamless database operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable database connections with proper error handling, so that the application remains stable and provides clear feedback when database issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish a connection pool to PostgreSQL with configurable parameters
2. WHEN a database connection fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and log detailed error information
3. WHEN connection pool reaches maximum capacity THEN the system SHALL queue requests and provide appropriate timeout handling
4. IF database connection is lost during operation THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection and notify administrators
5. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL provide structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated schema validation and migration capabilities, so that database schema changes can be deployed safely and consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate that the current database schema matches the expected schema version
2. WHEN schema validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about schema mismatches
3. WHEN running database migrations THEN the system SHALL execute them in a transaction and rollback on failure
4. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL preserve the previous schema state and log detailed error information
5. WHEN schema changes are detected THEN the system SHALL provide migration scripts to update the database structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive database connection monitoring and health checks, so that I can proactively identify and resolve database performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring database connections THEN the system SHALL track connection pool metrics including active, idle, and waiting connections
2. WHEN database response time exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL log performance warnings and alert administrators
3. WHEN performing health checks THEN the system SHALL verify database connectivity, schema integrity, and basic query performance
4. IF database health check fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information and suggested remediation steps
5. WHEN connection metrics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide real-time statistics about database performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure database connection management with proper credential handling, so that database access is protected and compliant with security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring database connections THEN the system SHALL support encrypted connection strings and credential management
2. WHEN establishing connections THEN the system SHALL use SSL/TLS encryption for all database communications
3. WHEN handling database credentials THEN the system SHALL never log or expose sensitive connection information
4. IF unauthorized database access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log security events and block suspicious connections
5. WHEN rotating database credentials THEN the system SHALL support graceful credential updates without service interruption

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want transaction management and query optimization tools, so that database operations are efficient and maintain data consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing multiple related database operations THEN the system SHALL provide transaction management with commit and rollback capabilities
2. WHEN long-running queries are detected THEN the system SHALL provide query cancellation and timeout mechanisms
3. WHEN executing database queries THEN the system SHALL log query performance metrics and identify slow queries
4. IF database deadlocks occur THEN the system SHALL automatically retry transactions with appropriate backoff strategies
5. WHEN optimizing database performance THEN the system SHALL provide query analysis and index usage recommendations
